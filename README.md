## [OpenACC_Ftn_Unified](https://github.com/PourroyJean/HPC_Playground/tree/master/OpenACC_Ftn_Unified)  
This Fortran program benchmarks GPU unified memory performance (such as MI300A) using OpenACC directives. It performs element-wise multiplication of large square matrices to measure execution time, memory bandwidth (GB/s), and computational throughput (GFLOPS).

## [Check_Binding](./Check_Binding)
Provides a simple check_binding.sh script demonstrating how to control CPU affinity, thread placement, and MPI distribution on Slurm-managed HPC clusters
